  We love seeing photos of the stuff you build in Minecraft so we thought we'd make it easier for you to share them. Here's a little app that automatically saves screenshots you take in Minecraft. You can then review them and post the most bodacious ones straight to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/minecraft">/r/minecraft</a>.
