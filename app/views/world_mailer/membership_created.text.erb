Hi <%= @user.username %>,

<%= @creator.username %> would like you to play in their Minecraft world "<%= @world.name %>". You can start playing here straight away by going to:

    <%= player_world_url(@world.creator.minecraft_player, @world) %>

and "Play here". The next time you connect to <%= @user.host %> in Minecraft you'll be connected to <%= @world.name %>.
