Hi <%= @creator.username %>,

<%= @user.username %> would like to play in "<%= @world.name %>". You can let them play in your world by going to:

    <%= user_world_members_url(@world.creator, @world) %>

You can also stalk <%= @user.username %> first at

    <%= user_url(@user) %>

<%= render partial: 'shared/email_sig' %>
