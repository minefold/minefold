Hi <%= @owner.username %>,

<%= @user.username %> would like to play in "<%= @world.name %>". You can let them play in your world by going to

    <%= edit_user_world_url(@owner, @world) %>

and adding <%= @user.username %> to the list of players. You can also stalk <%= @user.username %> first at

    <%= user_url(@user) %>
