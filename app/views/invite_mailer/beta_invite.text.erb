Hi <%= @invite.email %>!

<%= @invite.creator.username %> has invited you to be one of the first beta-testers for Minefold, our Minecraft hosting company. We've been working really hard and can't wait share what we've done with you.

First off, to get started sign up at:

<%= @invite.code %>

(If you don't have a Minecraft username, you can get one at http://minecraft.net)

You'll then be able to log in and view all the worlds. If you click on "<%= @world.name %>" you can see our personal world. If you click "Join world" you'll be spawned there when you connect to "<%= @world.host %>" in Minecraft.

If you've been playing single player you can import your world by pressing the big plus on the dashboard screen.

A few things to note:

** Minefold is beta! **
Things are bound to break. We'd appreciate it if you tell us about any problems, thoughts or suggestions you may have. Our contact details are:

	* Dave - dave@minefold.com, 04 1547 3249, @whatupdave
	* Chris - chris@minefold.com, 04 2412 1343, @chrislloyd

It may take a while (up to 2 minutes) to connect to your game. This is an known issue that we are working on and should be fixed soon.

** Worlds are public **
Everybody in the beta has access to any world you create. We'll be implementing permissions shortly, but in the mean time please be nice and don't grief other people's worlds.

** You'll need credits to play **
In the upper right hand side of the screen you'll see a little "<%= User::FREE_HOURS %> cr" which means you can play for <%= pluralize(User::FREE_HOURS, 'hour', 'hours') %>. We are giving you an hour free to say thanks for trying out the beta. If you want to play longer you can buy packs of 24, 48 and 72 hours.

When you pay with PayPal you'll notice that the account is "Chris Lloyd". Don't worry, he's not a nigerian scammer! It's me! We are trying to bootstrap the company and registered PayPal accounts are expensive so we are making do for the moment.

** The beta is private **
We'd appreciate it if you don't talk too much about Minefold. We'd love you to tell your friends but please don't post stuff to Reddit/Hacker News just yet :) If you want to invite your own friends you can use the handy form at the bottom of the page.

And lastly…

** Have fun and show us what you make! **
We'd love to see what you create, so let us know when you have something ready to show off.

We are super excited about Minefold and hope it'll help make playing Minecraft with your friends super simple.

Lots of love,

Dave and Chris
