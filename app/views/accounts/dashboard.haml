      Hi #{current_user.username},
    %p
      %em It's great to see you.
      If you <em>haven't</em> played Minecraft before or are new to multiplayer we have a #{link_to 'short guide to help you get started', help_page_path}. If you are ready to jump in and start playing you can either create a new world or upload one of your single player worlds.
    %p Don't hesitate to tell us if you have any problems at #{mail_to 'feedback@minefold.com'}.

    = link_to 'Create a new world', new_world_path, class: ['new', 'button']

      %strong Sad panda.
      You don't have any worlds you can play in. You can either #{link_to 'create one', new_world_path} or #{link_to 'upload an existing world', upload_path}.
