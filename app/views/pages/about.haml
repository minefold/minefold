  %h1 About Minefold
  %h2 We make it easier to play games with your friends.


%p We love games so much it hurts. We want to make playing them with your friends easy and fun. We found it waay too difficult to setup servers so we turned on our nerd and made our own game server grid. Running your own game server has never been simpler.

%p In December 2011, Minefold moved from Sydney to Mountain View to join the <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> Winter 2012 batch. We are now having a blast kicking ass in Hayes Valley, San Francisco.
