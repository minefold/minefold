  %h1 Minefold helps you connect and play games with your friends.

  %p Launched in November, 2011, Minefold is the easiest was to play multiplayer Minecraft. We remove all the boring stuff like running a server and just give you a georgous way to track and play.

  / %p TODO: Re-write in the context of change the world stuff. I.E. It was too hard to play together. We want to fix that. Remove story about loosing all our work.
  /
  / %p We happily played Minecraft together for months. Dave built this wicked rollercoaster and Chris was exploring the outer edges of an infinite universe. It was beautiful. We had rented a server, setup SSH access, configured a RAM disk, monitored the JVM and <em>oh God my brain hurts</em>. It was all too complicated. It wasn't long before Chris mistyped a command and all our hard work was lost.
  /
  / %p After we had wiped away the tears, we decided to rid the world of boring,difficult Minecraft hosting and let people just have fun building awesome stuff!

  /   %p <strong>Dave</strong> is the closest thing you'll find to the “rockstar programmer” cliché. When he's taking time out from learning new programming languages or working on a tricky back-end problem, he can often be found shirtless in #{link_to 'Ding Dong Dang', 'http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/bars/venues/2178/ding-dong-dang'} singing karaoke with his eyes closed.

  /   %p <strong>Chris</strong> has always seen himself as a slashie. That's Designer / Developer, not the other way around. Chris is passionate about clean design, minimalism and hipster music. He'd share a band with you but you wouldn't have heard of them yet.
