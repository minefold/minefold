%p
  %strong Your privacy is critically important to us.
  At Minefold we have a few fundamental principles:

%ol
  %li We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  %li We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  %li We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
  %li In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
  %li Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: 

%p If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.

%p Minefold operates the website minefold.com. It is Minefold’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating this website.

%h2 Website Visitors

%p Like most website operators, Minefold collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Minefold’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Minefold’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Minefold may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

%p Minefold also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments. Minefold only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

%h2 Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

%p Certain visitors to Minefold’s websites choose to interact with Minefold in ways that require Minefold to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Minefold gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask users who sign up to play at minefold.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Minefold – by purchasing credit to play on the Minefold game infrastructure, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Minefold collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Minefold. Minefold does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

%h2 Aggregated Statistics

%p Minefold may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its service. For instance, Minefold may monitor the most popular game worlds on the site or analyse chat logs to help identify spam. Minefold may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Minefold does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

%h2 Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

%p Minefold discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Minefold’s behalf or to provide services available at Minefold’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Minefold’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Minefold will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Minefold discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Minefold believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Minefold, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Minefold website and have supplied your email address, Minefold may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Minefold and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Minefold takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

%h2 Cookies

%p A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Minefold uses cookies to help Minefold identify and track visitors, their usage of the Minefold website, and their website access preferences. Minefold visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Minefold’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Minefold’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

%h2 Business Transfers

%p If Minefold, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Minefold goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Minefold may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

%h2 Privacy Policy Changes

%p Although most changes are likely to be minor, Minefold may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Minefold’s sole discretion. Minefold encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
