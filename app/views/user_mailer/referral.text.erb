Hi <%= @referral.email %>!

<%= @referral.creator.username %> has invited you to play Minecraft on Minefold. Minefold makes playing Minecraft with your friends super simple.

First off, to get started sign up at:

<%= new_user_registration_url(code: @referral.code) %>

(If you don't have a Minecraft username, you can get one at http://minecraft.net)

You'll then be able to log in and view all the worlds. If you click on "<%= @world.name %>" you can see our personal world.

If you've been playing single player you can import your world when you create a new world from the dashboard.

A few things to note:

** Minefold is beta! **
Things are bound to break. We'd appreciate it if you tell us about any problems, thoughts or suggestions you may have. Our contact details are:

	* Dave - dave@minefold.com, 04 1547 3249, @whatupdave
	* Chris - chris@minefold.com, 04 2412 1343, @chrislloyd

It may take a while (up to 2 minutes) to connect to your game. This is an known issue that we are working on.

** Worlds are public **
Everybody in the beta has access to any world you create. We aren't going to have any permissions whilst we are in beta, as we have a lot of trust in the community. Just please be nice and don't grief other people's worlds.

** You'll need credits to play **
In the upper right hand side of the screen you'll see "<%= pluralize(User::FREE_HOURS, 'hour', 'hours') %>" which means you can play for <%= pluralize(User::FREE_HOURS, 'hour', 'hours') %> for free.

And lastly…

** Have fun and show us what you make! **
We'd love to see what you create, so let us know when you have something ready to show off.

We are super excited about Minefold and hope it'll help make playing Minecraft with your friends super simple.

Lots of love,

Dave and Chris
